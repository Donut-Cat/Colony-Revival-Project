# INFORMATION! (READ THIS)

Welcome to the Colony Revival Project github! This is a page where you can review the code and make changes to help improve Colony forever with bugfixes and improvements to the existing code that I have managed to salvage into a working copy.

This is a team effort we need to be able to get full-access to the code so the community and programmers apart of it can help improve the games overall quality & to improve upon its already great foundation.

# How to help Colony Revival Project

To help, begin by reviewing the existing code for improvements that could be made. Features can be suggested under the 'Discussions' tab or the official Discord server.

Use pull requests & other methods of communicating to submit potential changes and feedback to the existing codebase. If you've made improvements to the .FLA file, please submit it as well with what you've changed or updated.

View what needs to be worked on under the 'Projects' tab. 

# How to Compile Colony Revival Project

1. Download and Install Adobe Flash Professional CS6!
2. Download this Project and open the .FLA file!
3. Go to File -> ActionScript Settings -> Confirm 'Export Classes in frame' is set to 1.
4. Confirm 'Source Path' contains a path to your directory where the .FLA and other files are contained.
5. Confirm 'Document Class' is correctly specified by pressing the checkmark button beside it.

File -> Publish Preview -> Flash to test and confirm the game is running.

# EVERYTHING ELSE

Alright, let's go over some things here:

- This is not a bug-free release, here are the current bugs that need to be squashed, please help if you can:
  
  - When finishing a match online or offline, the defeat/victory screen button does nothing. Code-related issue.
  - Various graphics are not layered properly, meaning certain parts of the vector graphics appear under or above certain other objects incorrectly.
  - If you don't have the games original fonts, fonts will instead use your systems default font and things will appear incorrectly aligned. I recommend finding and using the games original fonts online.

- This was uploaded under the knowledge that Krin the original developer is understandably okay with this and fine with us creating a private server to continue his marvelous game forever with multiplayer. I'm sure he wouldn't mind us also improving upon his 12 year old game like this!

Getting that out of the way, have fun!
